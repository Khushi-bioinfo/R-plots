We have been approached by an Analytics Consultant from a movie review website. They are writing up an article analyzing movie rating by critics and audience as well as movie budgets for the years 2007 to 2011 
They have asked us to look at the data and provide them with 5 graphs. WE have been given an excel sheet has information on movies, its genre, year in which they were released, Critic Rating(Rotten Tomatoes Rating) and Audience Rating.
